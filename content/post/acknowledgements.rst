Acknowlegements and Attributions
################################

Every project, no matter how lonely, builds upon the efforts of others.
:title:`Hugo Restructured` is no different.

.. pull-quote::

   If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.

   -- Isaac Newton, 1675.


Acknowlegements
***************

:title:`Hugo Restructured` started as an attempt to understand
the very useful
`Ananke Theme <https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/>`__.

`Bud Parr <https://github.com/budparr>`__
has done us all a great favor with his careful development of this theme.
:title:`Ananke` proved to be one of the better teaching tools I found
for understanding how templates actually work in Hugo.

If one looks at :title:`Hugo Restructured` the right way,
the bare bones of :title:`Ananke` are still evident.
However, not much if any of the original remains;
by the time I was done swapping out the Tachyons.io foundation
and swapping in reStructuredText
and then tackling various random ideas,
just about every file was ripped open, pulled apart,
and then reassembled |--| sometimes in a very different way.


Attributions

A "wall of text" is rarely pleasant to look at.
Good images help the readability of almost any text.
The world is made richer by those artists who share their work
through the creative commons.
